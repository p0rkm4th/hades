# Current blockers and owner gates

This is a public, sanitized handoff. Live machine identities, addresses,
private account identifiers, credentials, deployment identifiers, and raw
acceptance transcripts belong in protected operator records. These statements
summarize engineering evidence; they are not a live infrastructure probe.

## Release baseline

Public `main` is `e939b3caac8760291f610d2d428795956257ccb4`, fast-forwarded
from `codex/inference-read-freshness-20261004`. Public CI passed on the
matching candidate ref (run `37227907387`) before promotion. The new source
labels ambiguous HADES guest matches per Proxmox scope, exposes source read
times, timestamps provider model-location answers, and discloses when another
configured inference provider is unavailable. Focused tests cover these
changes and sequential Proxmox runtime/backup outages.

The current production UI dogfood used the previously deployed overlay and
adapter; it exposed the HADES placement ambiguity and missing model-location
timestamp fixed in this source. Those fixes are not yet deployed. Compose the
Hermes overlay against the exact active artifact, deploy with hash-guarded
rollback, update the profile-selected adapter with protected rollback, then
repeat owner and household acceptance. Source `main` being green alone does
not close live runtime parity or the broader homelab gates. No production
deployment has occurred for this candidate.

Previously published history is preserved and still contains older private
identifiers. Current-tree sanitization and the introduced-range path/address
audit do not erase or certify every older public commit. The current branch tip
removes the destination-specific acceptance records and per-user share mapping,
uses explicit operator hostname input, and uses synthetic guest identities.

## Homelab read reliability — PARTIAL

HADES composes configured Proxmox, NetBox, Uptime Kuma, service-native, and
inference observations without creating a second inventory authority. Owner
reads distinguish freshness, conflicts, and unknowns. Current evidence does not
establish every intended node, service, GPU, backup, or network condition.
Host utilization is available only for observed Proxmox node rows; network
trends, general host operating-system state, in-guest service health,
filesystem capacity, and backup restoreability remain unknown unless a current
source explicitly provides them. Household status remains unknown when no
approved household-safe live check is configured.

A synthetic NetBox outage test now seeds a stable Proxmox-to-NetBox link before
withdrawing NetBox. The adapter retains current Proxmox runtime and removes the
prior inventory identity, while a stale Kuma observation remains stale. A
separate authenticated UI test found and fixed local read-only adapter fallback
registration for deterministic owner routes; the post-fix UI acceptance passed.

Remaining work:

- exercise stale-source and partial-source-outage behavior against live and
  synthetic feeds without promoting cached data to live truth;
- verify contradictory Proxmox/NetBox/Kuma observations remain visible;
- reconcile stable identity links and service placements;
- qualify backup coverage separately from local copies, contents, and restore
  success;
- complete reboot and synthetic restore acceptance;
- continue owner and household dogfood for service placement, failures, model
  inventory, and distributed placement;
- retain read-only enforcement and household redaction under partial outages.

Do not infer current state from a capability matrix, prior chat, memory, or an
old report. No infrastructure mutation authority is included.

## Separate owner or external gates

- Production cutover, client/DNS changes, or retirement of an existing runtime
  require their own explicit owner decision.
- Real household onboarding requires the selected identity and credential
  flow.
- Real finance, Home Assistant, off-host encrypted recovery custody, and
  privileged browser workflows remain separately gated.
- Infrastructure changes discovered during read-only inspection are assigned
  to the authorized infrastructure operator; HADES integration work must not
  modify hosts, networks, drivers, or hypervisor state.

## Evidence location

Detailed private acceptance records and the canonical machine matrix belong in
protected `hades-infra`. Public fixtures and contracts use synthetic names,
addresses, credentials, and measurements.
